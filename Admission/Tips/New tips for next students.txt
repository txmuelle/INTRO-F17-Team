Tips & Tricks for the next INTRO students
- What to do 
- What not to do
- How to learn effectively
- Anything else which comes to your mind
- Add your name (will be removed before publishing next semester)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Erich Styger: Prepare yourself in advance: read the slides, read the scriptum, don't wait until the exam period. Make sure you submit your tips early in the semester.
- Matthias Schwegler: If you have questions about the content of the slides consider the script. Use the script additional to the slides.
- Markus Birrer: Go always to the lessons.
- Raphael Andonie: If there's an error occurring in Processor Expert after "Git pull", close the current project and reopen it. It might be fixed.
- Kevin Bieri: Try always to understand the existing source code before you make some changes. 
- Philipp Stocker: Try to write a good commit message. What and why was a change necessary. You help your colleagues and it keeps the commit history cleaner.
- Tobias Dubacher: Decide which person program the "remote" and which the "robot"
- Frowin Imholz: If you have a lot of quadrature encoder errors, check the timing and priorities of the reflectance sensors (heavy system load).
- Adrian Ruckli: Make familiar with the Segger-Tools, e.g. the SystemView or J-Scope, they are very helpful to illustrate your running MCU.
- Robert Näger: Take some time in the beginning of the semester to understand the structure of the project.
- Ueli Schweizer: Do not do the labs a week after the input, the inputs usually contain the most important points of the lab and it is easier if you do it after inputs.
- Tobias Walker: Do not change the same processor expert file on two laptops and push it to GitHub. The file will not work anymore and you have to reload an older version.
- Sandro Arnold: If you have to change the H-Bridge use a hot air soldering station and cover the surrounding area with kapton tape. 
- Silvano Stecher: Make a group with someone who has already used Kientis and the enviroment (e.g. in PREN). He/She can help you at the beginning ot the course.
- Michi Weber: Invest a bit of time in your Recaps. They refresh the topics of last weeks and your colleagues will be thankful.
- Marco Brun: In the first week, Mr. Styger will give you same tips to optimize Kinetis Design Studio. Do them all, there are reasons he is telling you that!
- Tobias Heer: Take some time to walk/step through new code, even if you didn’t implement much and everything is working like a charm.
- Tobias Kreienbühl: On a Lenovo Notebook, you can lock the function-keys with fn + esc.
- Tobias Kreienbühl: On Linux you can find your device with the command dmesg | grep tty for UART and USB-CDC.
- Tobias Kreienbühl: On Linux minicom can be useful for a easy console communication. Call it with: sudo minicom -b <baudrate> -o -D /dev/<interface of your device>
- Silvan Ritz: Use the bluetooth module. It's not that hard to use (on Windows) and it's easier to test the motors and encoders if there is no annoying USB- Cable.
- Brian Hunziker: As soon as a Tip comes into your mind, write it down, so you don't lose time thinking of a tip to admit once admission deadline is reached.
- Lorenz Isenegger: Make yourself used to GIT at the begining of the course. Saves you loads of Errors, Merges, Diffs and frustration.
- Manuel Felber: Make yourself familiar with FRTOS functions like Semaphore, Queues and Mutex. It's easier to understand the last labs.
- Simon Durrer: If your PE Init_USB_OTG component always loose the clock settings after pulling from git, try to exclude it form the FSL_USB_Stack component.
- Simon Durrer: Make sure your debug settings are stored in your KDS project so your partner is also able to debug.
- Cyrill Stoffel: Make sure that your tick rate in FRTOS is 1 kHz.
- Thomas Gut: If you have strange problems (errors) in your code, which you can't explane, clean your project, close it. When you reopen and rebuild it, the error may is solved.
- Patrick Zihlmann: Do the labs step by step and try do unterstand what each step is used for, it will help you to unterstand the code.
- Walker Marvin: Never underestimate the power of the shell. Therefore, make sure your shell is working properly from the beginning.
- Walker Marvin: Do not leave from class earlier on fridays, otherwise you will miss Mr Styger's weekly joke.
- Manuel Agner: If something don’t work, think what it needs to work from out of the method/threads, becose mostly the fault isn’t in the code.
- Lukas Geisshüsler: Cleaning your project sometimes can magically solve strange errors.
- Kilian Ineichen: If suddenly nothing is working anymore, you should look if your heap size is too small.
- Ervin Mazlagic: Add to the robot schematic a note for the gear ratio and encoder resolution.
- Ervin Mazlagic: Make a sketch of the PID control and write down the scaling factor of the parameters.
